    Food Day in the United States is celebrated annually on October 24 and often throughout the month. The celebration was started in 1975 by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in an attempt to create an event similar to Earth Day. Food Day in the U.S. was created to raise awareness about the increasing industrialization of American agriculture, rising food prices, hunger, and the American diet and health crisis.[1] Food Day in the U.S. only lasted until 1977, until 2011, when CSPI revived the National Food Day campaign. The Food Day initiative is now run by Food Day.org within CSPI.

Food Day is still focused on raising awareness and changing behaviors related to food in the U.S. Issues of concern include: nutrition education, food rescue, sustainable agriculture, hunger, farm animal welfare, and farm and food service worker rights.[2] Food Day in the U.S.
